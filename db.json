But while condemning Nehru’s actions, the US President openly sympathized with his ongoing struggles against colonialism. ‘Like many others, I grew up in a community where the people were barely a generation away from colonial rule,’ he wrote. ‘And I can claim the company of most historians in saying that the colonialism to which my immediate ancestors were subject was more sterile, oppressive, and even cruel than that of India. The legacy of Clive was on the whole more tolerable than that of Cromwell.’</p><p>By comparing Oliver Cromwell and Robert Clive, however debatably, JFK underscored a fundamental point of connection between the two nations: both had emerged from the stifling womb of British rule.</p>"

"text": "<p>If the independence movements of the US and India bore a resemblance, so, too, did their early experiences in building a republic. Following Britain’s departure, each faced the same challenge: how to create a federal union out of a group of separate, sometimes disparate, states. Each had a strong, anti-federalist contingent, which feared its own interests would be subsumed by the larger union. Owing to its sheer size, population and diversity, India undoubtedly had the harder job; while America’s anti-federalists were ‘outmaneuvered, out-argued, and ultimately outvoted’ by the nationalists, as Joseph Ellis writes, India’s opposition, comprised predominantly of Muslims, was granted a separate state.</p><p>Indeed, like America 150 years before, India was blessed at birth with a set of wise and principled leaders who guided the country with foresight and courage. Gandhi can be viewed as a sort of nonviolent George Washington, the visionary ‘father of his country’ who cast off the British and worked unrelentingly to secure peace and harmony in his homeland. (It’s no coincidence that both are prominently featured on the currencies of their respective nations.)</p>"

Drafted in 1787 by what Thomas Jefferson, then stationed in Paris, described as ‘an assembly of demigods,’ Sinha called it ‘the soundest and most practical and workable republican constitution in existence.’ Noting that it had served as a model for the republics of France, Canada, Australia and South Africa, he continued, ‘I have no doubt that you will also, in the nature of things, pay in the course of your work greater attention to the provisions of the American constitution than to any other.’</p><p>Indeed, India’s Constitution spelled out more civil liberties than any other. It instituted universal suffrage for all men and women over 21, established a secular state, guaranteed free speech, and banned the caste system, freeing 60 million untouchables. In a gesture way ahead of its time, it even called for ‘equal pay for equal work for both men and women.’</p>"

The language of America’s fifth amendment, dictating due process before the law, can also be glimpsed in India’s Fundamental Rights: both prohibit citizens from being tried for the same crime twice, and both ensure that a suspected criminal cannot be ‘compelled’ to ‘be a witness against himself.’ Like America’s, India’s Constitution stipulates that the president appoint the justices to the federal Supreme Court.

When Delhi came asking Washington in 1965 to shore up its wheat aid programme, known as PL-480, President Johnson said no. In 1954, the year PL-480 began, India imported 1 million tons of grain; ten years later, imports had risen to 5.5 million tons, a jump only partly attributable to population growth. With India facing severe drought—grain production plummeted from 89 to 72 million tons that year —Johnson adopted a ‘short tether’ approach, approving shipments of two months’ and then one month’s worth of grain at a time, providing humanitarian aid but hoping to force the government to reform its moribund agricultural policy<strong>.</strong> The following year, with the drought persisting, Johnson went even further, implementing what came to be known as the ‘ship to mouth’ policy — essentially keeping the supply line so short there was no cushion against famine.</p><p>For many Indians, this was the final indignity that drove a permanent wedge between the US and India — one that still mars the relationship half a century later. Washington’s strict food aid policy may have been nothing more than a standard show of hard-nosed diplomacy, but under-confident India — accustomed to playing the victim — saw it as the ruthless politicking of a powerful bully.</p>"
